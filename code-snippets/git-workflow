## What I Learned Today
Git Repository Setup Process:

1. Initialize local repository:
   - `git init`

2. Create GitHub repository:
   - Created through GitHub website
   - Named it "programming-journal"

3. Connect local to remote:
   - `git remote add origin [repository-url]`
   - Verified with `git remote -v`

4. Commit and Push Process:
   - `git add .` (stages all changes)
   - `git commit -m "meaningful message here"`
   - `git push origin main`

Note: Always verify changes are staged with `git status`
Pulling will be covered in another file once I actually use it.
