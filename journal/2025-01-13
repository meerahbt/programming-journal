## What I Did Today
Git course 1 
BookBot Guided Project
Journal Project 

## What I Learned Today
A lot about git, and setting up a repo and general workflow
A good understanding of how git works 
Overall, better practice of CLI and its usage

## Code/Concept Notes
[Git-Workflow](../code-snippets/git-workflow)

I thought I knew how git worked before this course but I didn't. I learned a lot about the workflow and how to use it and now feel pretty comfortable. I also am way more comfortable with the CLI and kind of hate the GUI of vscode. I will eventually move to vim or neovim when I'm more comfortable touch typing. 

## VLOG
Will upload later.

## For Tomorrow
    - Start OOP course
    - See if managing this daily is sustainable for me or not with university

Side note, I don't ever want to be in a position where I'm not gonna learn something now because I won't have time to update this log. So I will try to be as accurate as I can but will prioritize learning.
