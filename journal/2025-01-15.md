## Day: 68
## What I Did Today
Object Orientated Programming Course
* Finished it --apart from the challenges

## What I Learned Today
I got waayy more in depth regarding how classes, intances and methods work. I learned a lot today but I got pretty fatigued towards the end since there was a lot to learn and practice.

## Code/Concept Notes
I might scrap this part since I want to get used to looking up documentation instead of just rewriting or copy pasting stuff into notes I won't look into. So I think I'll only do it for workflow stuff that I like but I might change my mind in the future.

## For Tomorrow 
    - Finish OOP challenges
    - Plan for the coming week
    - Start FP course 

Forgot I was supposed to plan for the current week.
