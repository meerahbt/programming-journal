## Day: 73
## What I Did Today
Finished functional programming

## What I Learned Today
There was a lot that I learned today but not in depth as I would have liked. It was a good amount of breadth but will have to make time for the depth sooner or later. 

I also left out a lot of the challenges to act as refreshers and better reinforcement of what I have learned previously rather than just go off of memorization of syntax.
