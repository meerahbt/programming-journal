## Day: 77
## What I Did Today
TTodo program work:
- arg parsing
- add tasks
- some error handling 
- reading and writing from json 
- print list function

## What I Learned Today

I feel like I learned a lot about how to write programs 'on my own' (using AI for help but not to write it all for me). It's been fun to problem solve and plan out this program. I learned about how to manage and organize your code a bit more but I'm not sure if this is the best way to do it yet to be honest.

## For Tomorrow
    - Finish Ttodo

Overall, I'm a bit behind schedule for January I think. I underestimated how long some things would take me but that's fine since the progress overall has been good.
