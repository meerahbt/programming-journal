## Day: 80
## What I Did Today
50% done with SSG

## What I Learned Today

I learned more about unittest on python. I'm a bit more comfortable with classes now. This is a good way to get a refresher on HTML as well. Getting more and more comfortable writing code by the day.

## For Tomorrow
    - More work on SSG

I do however feel like this would be very hard for me to do without the help of boots. I ask a lot of questions as I'm learning but I want to be able to redo this project on my own eventually.
