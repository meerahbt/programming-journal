## What I Learned Today
I spent a lot of time thinking about abstraction in programming today. I have been struggling a lot with that lately and I feel like I always want to understand what is going on at a lower level. The general advice I have gotten so far is to just bite the bullet and keep going and eventually the time will come for me to learn the other things I want to learn.
