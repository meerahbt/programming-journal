## Early Days Learning

I started documenting my day to day progress after the first day. I also wrote blog posts periodically. I usually have a lot of thoughts when I'm learning to be honest and always try to find an outlet to express them. Sometimes I get feedback or it sparks a conversion and other times I'm just speaking into the void. Below are all the posts I've made dated.

## First Month Progress

cs50x | mario problem
27 Jul, 2024

Today, after a struggle of a couple hours, managed to solve the first real problem of CS50x, the Mario problem. Along with some of the exercises I did in the C book, this is some of the most fun I have had while learning programming so far. It makes me really excited for the rest of the course and programming in general. The point of this post is to release some of the energy I got from the pride of solving the problem on my own (even if it is a simple problem in the grand scheme of things).

coding my own programs for the first time
09 Aug, 2024

Today I finished coding a simple grocery list program and for some reason before this, it hasn't really hit me that I can just go ahead and make stuff. I don't need to follow an exercise, course or a tutorial I can just create a new C file and code. Obviously, I knew prior to this that this was a possibility but I always felt like I needed to be at a certain skill set before I can do that. I think CS50x really opened my eyes of how to learn how to program and how to learn by making. This is now the second breakthrough I've had after the finishing the first problem set of the course and my will to learn just keeps growing and growing. I'm trying not to worry to much about my pace since I feel like it's a bit slow but I have to remind myself that this is still only a hobby at the moment and I have other priorities currently (my graphic design degree) that have to take the forefront.

Until my next breakthrough, Meerah

# Month in Blog Post

a month in
21 Aug, 2024

I'm currently slightly over a month since I started programming. I think it's unbelievable how much I've been able to learn in the past month and I have no intention of stopping soon. I've just barely scratched the surface and can't wait to keep going. I made a new account on x dot com where I think I'll be documenting more, asking more questions and just generally looking to improve and learn.

I tend to have doubts every now and then. Am I too old (23 btw) to be starting this now? Will I ever catchup? Is it worth all this time? But to be honest, I'm enjoying this journey too much to let the doubts I currently have stop. Even if I never "catch up", I don't think it matters.

I'm always open to any advice or suggestions on what/how to learn if anyone even sees this.

Current plan: CS50 (on week 7) -> The C Programming Book -> Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective

# Daily Updates (Starting from Day 35)

day 35 > learning cs/programming

- finished week 6/10 cs50 onto week 7
- learning more about "creative coding" which will probably be my graphic design senior project 

(started uni again so cs prog will prob slow down a bit)

---

day 36 > learning cs/programming
(slow day for learning)

- starting week 7 cs50 
- wrote most of a tic tac toe simulation program (will finish it later today if i feel better, if not tmrw)

---

day 37 > learning cs/programming

- cs50 week 7 lecture done 
- spent most of my learning time on processing for my senior project (this part is more for my graphic design tbh but i'll include it in these logs since its technically coding too) 

now i can sleep

---

day 38 > learning cs/programming

- cs50 week 7 done + all psets (kinda boring week tbh) 
- learned how to manage my files w git and set it up for senior project work too (this took way too long) 
- learned more about terminal scripts and aliases thanks to the above

---

day 39 > learning cs/programming

-cs50 week 8 lecture + psets

this took all day lol, i expected it to be boring but creating the homepage was fun but took forever

---

day 40 > learning cs/programming

- started week 9 cs50
- focused more on gd/processing today

---

day 41 > learning cs/programming

- cs50 week 9 lecture

---

day 42 > learning cs/programming

- long uni today so barely anything
- finished cs50 week 9 lecture + notes

---

day 44> learning cs/programming 

this literally took all day

-cs50 finance (last pset!!!!!!)
- still need to implement one more feature of my own before i can submit it

---

day 45> learning cs/programming

- implemented my own feature (changing password) 
- also did week0 pset that i missed for some reason

tmrw onwards its final project (ascii renderer)

---

day 46> learning cs/programming 

- finally started ascii renderer in c
(using stb_image & stb_image_write) tbh idk what libraries i should be using but this one loads and lets me write diff file types
- my program can read & write image files and convert them to grayscale

---

day 50> learning cs/programming

- spent a lot of time figuring out where i wanna take computational gd and potential topics that can come out of it 
- finally getting into cs:app

main goals for weekend ->get a clearer direction for what i wanna do & learn 4 cs & gd & senior

been at a place where i wanna do so many things and end up being stuck and overwhelmed. i need to be more specific and break down everything into steps so that i get stuff done bit by bit instead of start so many things at once. uni stuff is getting in the way but theyre also stuff i care about tbh, so excited for a lot of it, the gd and programming

---

day 51 > learning cs/programming

ascii-render in c progress:
- implemented conversion function (prob still needs work)
- also implemented scaling
- implemented printing but still needs to be fixed to work with scaling 

also did a lot of uni work, good day 

---

day 52 > learning cs/programming

ascii renderer:
- i spent a few hours on it today but didn’t really implement much. most of the time was spent on cementing C fundamentals to make sure x function works as intended and really confirm i understand why and how it works.

---

day 53> learning cs/programming 

cs:app chp1 stuff + a bit more
- theory stuff today (video links below)

feeling very overwhelmed with the material ngl i think nand2tetris might be a better introduction to computer systems for me -> then do cs:app (?)

---

day 54> learning cs/programming 

shifting to sicp from csapp for now
- functional programming lectures
- will read through 1.1 before bed
- recursion excersizes

this is what i'll be following, not sure how fast i can go given uni work tbh but we'll see 

---

day 55> learning cs/programming

- read sicp 1.1
(exercises tmrw morning)

lots of uni work done today tho (gd)

---

day 56> learning cs/programming

-did the exercises this morning

---

day 57> learning cs/programming

- set up scheme to work better on my laptop
- solved a couple of questions from the sicp week 1 hw

another big uni day today, did as much as i can to stay ahead and have more time for programming stuff, i just keep getting more work to do 

---

day 58> learning cs/programming
  
- basic ascii renderer built in c 
- wrote the readme for cs50 (only video left) 
- more sicp exercises

---

day 59 > learning cs/programming

- submitted my cs50 project and got my certificate finally 😁
- read through sicp 1.3 for week 2 material, i’m so rusty with math i could barely follow what was happening ngl i hope the lectures make it easier to follow

it feels like i understand the concepts in theory but when an example is given i kinda get lost, idw brute force my way through this but for now i might have to. if i really get stuck i’ll take a step back and come back to it later or even go through the book & lectures twice

---

day 60 > learning cs/programming

sicp lecture 3
- this cleared up A LOT of the issues i had in the reading, will keep going

we hit the ~2 month mark 🎉 i think i wanna go more indepth with what i’ve learned so far

also i think ill keep an hourly timer to see how many hours i put in, its probably around 120-150hour range if i had to guess till now, an average of 1-2hours a day makes sense esp for considering slower learning days

---

day 61 > learning cs/programming    

sicp lecture 4 
- again more things are becoming clearer to me 
- thinking more about procedures as data is kinda cool

# 2 Months In Blog Post 

16 Sep, 2024

I've been self-studying programming and computer science for about 2 months now. I've often found myself overwhelmed and filled with doubt about whether I'm learning correctly or not. Studying day by day it sometimes feels like I've made little to no progress but to be honest, that's being completely unfair to myself. I started from 0 and considering that last week I was able to build an ASCII renderer in C is crazy to think about. Such a minor achievement, in the grand scheme of things, but it's still something.

This blog posts and daily updates on x have been purely for myself. I want to be able to look back on everything I did to learn and hold myself accountable at the same time. I completed CS50 and now reading SICP and following along with the complimentary lectures. I'm not 100% sure if this is the best way to go about learning this stuff, but I'd rather just dive in and start making progress instead of spending even more time trying to figure out my next move.

I aim for 1-2 hours of learning daily, it's the most sustainable schedule for me right now, considering I'm still not done with my graphic design degree. I don't want to fall into the trap of grinding for hours and cramming new information since these new concepts (especially in SICP) take me some time to grasp.

Two months is a very short time when looking at the big picture. If this is how I can learn in two months then I can't wait to see what I know in 10 years.

# Daily Updates Cont.

day 62 > learning cs/programming

long day yesterday
- worked on a small webcam to ascii on terminal in python. i needed something quick as part of my field research. this was more for gd than comp sci tbh

---

day 63 > learning cs/programming

did some sicp exercises, this will probably be more of my focus this weekend and planning what would be a good side project for me to work on

---

day 64 > learning cs/programming

(this weekend is gonna be a slow one)

not much tbh, just looking at potential projects to work on. current options:
- cli shell 
- 2d top down game engine (maybe too big idk)
- text based game engine 

---

# Break

Things got a bit overwhelming to be honest and I think I was trying to learn too much at once and got too overwhelmed. I'm back now and documenting the daily updates. I try to put more thought into the update but it's hard to maintain that daily. Each update is in the journals directory.
